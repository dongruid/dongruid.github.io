Hi, this is Dongrui. I am a second year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. \\
I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree in [Neural Computation](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/index.html) and [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) Joint PhD Program. \\
My research focuses on understanding the geometry of neural representation. \\
For more information about me, please refer to the [homepage provided by my department](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/people/students/pnc/dongruid.html).
